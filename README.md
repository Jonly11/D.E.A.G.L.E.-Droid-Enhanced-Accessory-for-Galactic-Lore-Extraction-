Users can easily navigate through the data using side-mounted push buttons, and the device automatically enters sleep mode after 20 seconds of inactivity to conserve power. With a thematically designed 3D-printed casing created in Fusion 360, it offers durability, protection, and aesthetic appeal. The device is mounted to a users shirt using embedded magnets on the casing and backing plate. D.E.A.G.L.E. provides an engaging and fun experience, inviting users to explore the Star Wars universe one starship at a time.
